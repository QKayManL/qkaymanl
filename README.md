## 👁️ Why I Do It  
I blend **human creativity** with **AI-powered tools**, turning design ideas into visuals that pop — and code that delivers. My background is in graphic design, and I’m now supercharging that with front-end development + AI. My Visual-ISTJ learning style means I thrive on clear structure, strong visuals and interactive workflows.

## 🛠️ Currently Working On  
- Building a premium app that brings brands and creative professionals together (web + mobile)  
- Learning modern front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React  
- Exploring AI for design automation: prompt engineering, generative visuals, workflow tools  
- Sharing visual tutorials and interactive demos that help others learn by seeing and doing

## 🎨 My Toolbox  
**Design & Creative Tools:** Photoshop · Illustrator · After Effects · Midjourney/Stable Diffusion  
**Front-End Development:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · React · Git/GitHub  
**AI & Visual Learning:** Prompt engineering · Flowcharts & diagrams · Interactive sandboxes · Code interpreter workflows

## 🚀 Formats I Love  
Intuitive visuals and structured modules = the win. Here’s how I approach a new skill:  
1. **See it** — diagram, flowchart or visual layout  
2. **Try it** — build a small demo or interactive piece  
3. **Refine it** — debug, restructure, optimise  
4. **Share it** — blog, repo, tutorial, visual breakdown  

That’s how I learn *and* grow.
